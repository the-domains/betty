Next time I’ll be bee-lining to the Egyptian and Islamic artifacts and mostly skipping the galleries of paintings.</h3>"},{"block":{"id":"82c80b33-46df-4d4c-9542-a4d38177ca5b","item":"2c4f8b91-f250-4d97-b48c-ec7e58b9313b","type":"h3","html":"<h3>May 13, 2016</h3>","created_at":"2016-08-08T14:00:50.730Z","updated_at":null,"metadata":{"starred":true,"source":"2c4f8b91-f250-4d97-b48c-ec7e58b9313b","publisher":{}},"src":null,"text":"May 13, 2016","measurementHash":"157c2364fe26a487c1a4d830f86154e4","length":12,"measurementVersion":16},"html":"<h3>May 13, 2016</h3>"},{"block":{"id":"d91919c1-028c-428f-b13f-852d0168620c","item":"2c4f8b91-f250-4d97-b48c-ec7e58b9313b","type":"h3","html":"<h3>May 10, 2016</h3>","created_at":"2016-08-08T14:00:50.730Z","updated_at":null,"metadata":{"starred":true,"source":"2c4f8b91-f250-4d97-b48c-ec7e58b9313b","publisher":{}},"src":null,"text":"May 10, 2016","measurementHash":"30cabb070e19ca81945de99ce226583e","length":12,"measurementVersion":16},"html":"<h3>May 10, 2016</h3>"},{"block":{"id":"cc9aa876-8eb9-42fb-805f-ea5afa0934f3","item":"2c4f8b91-f250-4d97-b48c-ec7e58b9313b","type":"h3","html":"<h3>May 6, 2016</h3>","created_at":"2016-08-08T14:00:50.730Z","updated_at":null,"metadata":{"starred":true,"source":"2c4f8b91-f250-4d97-b48c-ec7e58b9313b","publisher":{}},"src":null,"text":"May 6, 2016","measurementHash":"889372828a5410b0af5994f6b6639944","length":11,"measurementVersion":16},"html":"<h3>May 6, 2016</h3>"},{"block":{"id":"aa86548d-24ce-413a-a9f2-f653de7e1026","item":"2c4f8b91-f250-4d97-b48c-ec7e58b9313b","type":"h3","html":"<h3>May 1st, 2016</h3>","created_at":"2016-08-08T14:00:50.730Z","updated_at":null,"metadata":{"starred":true,"source":"2c4f8b91-f250-4d97-b48c-ec7e58b9313b","publisher":{}},"src":null,"text":"May 1st, 2016","measurementHash":"ef56863e3a87e55a7d0dc6e0391ab825","length":13,"measurementVersion":16},"html":"<h3>May 1st, 2016</h3>"}],"textual":[{"block":{"id":"288f2649-5ca5-45e6-a56a-ad50554a704d","item":"2c4f8b91-f250-4d97-b48c-ec7e58b9313b","type":"text","html":"<p>Traveling is sorta hard.</p>","created_at":"2016-08-08T14:00:50.730Z","updated_at":null,"metadata":{"starred":true,"source":"2c4f8b91-f250-4d97-b48c-ec7e58b9313b","publisher":{}},"src":null,"text":"Traveling is sorta hard.","measurementHash":"ce0c12f39417353be0aca69064f29acb","length":24,"language":"en","measurementVersion":16},"html":"<p>Traveling is sorta hard.</p>"},{"block":{"id":"45c69205-ea2f-4c2e-a711-b6c2b7ef6460","item":"2c4f8b91-f250-4d97-b48c-ec7e58b9313b","type":"text","html":"<p>I’ve long romanticized travel as this amazing thing only the privileged get to do.
