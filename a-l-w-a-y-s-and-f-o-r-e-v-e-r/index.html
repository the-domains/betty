That was when I started to think about, \"Hey girl, you should take your passport out of your backpack from that fun trip to Canada last month. Oh hey, let's set it on the bookshelf under that stuff there. I won't forget it's there. No way.\" Come nearly Mid-April, the passport was nowhere to be found. With absolute panic, I Ubered to the county building and rushed in every way possible an application for new papers... which I was assured would be in my hands no later than April 29th -- I was told not to freak out till May 1. And freak out I did April 27th when I got an email that my application was on hold due to a form they needed in hardcopy (although I had submitted it online... this was the DS-64, a form stating how you lost your passport. I had simply put, \"I'm stressed out and somehow I misplaced it. I have no idea how.\") Since it's 1974 at the Passport office, I needed to resubmit this form in blood, hand delivered by Pony Express...Thence, the panic really was building. I wasn't sleeping, I was pounding coffee, eating excessively to soothe, and hittin' that bong like nothing.

Next time I’ll be bee-lining to the Egyptian and Islamic artifacts and mostly skipping the galleries of paintings.</h3>"},{"block":{"id":"f71dd2f5-8da4-4fec-b856-45916e2c6a25","item":"2c4f8b91-f250-4d97-b48c-ec7e58b9313b","type":"h3","html":"<h3>May 13, 2016</h3>","created_at":"2016-08-08T14:36:50.114Z","updated_at":null,"metadata":{"starred":true,"source":"2c4f8b91-f250-4d97-b48c-ec7e58b9313b","publisher":{}},"src":null,"text":"May 13, 2016","measurementHash":"157c2364fe26a487c1a4d830f86154e4","length":12,"measurementVersion":16},"html":"<h3>May 13, 2016</h3>"},{"block":{"id":"6bb9f51b-1bf3-4bf2-a755-60d12dc193d4","item":"2c4f8b91-f250-4d97-b48c-ec7e58b9313b","type":"h3","html":"<h3>May 10, 2016</h3>","created_at":"2016-08-08T14:36:50.114Z","updated_at":null,"metadata":{"starred":true,"source":"2c4f8b91-f250-4d97-b48c-ec7e58b9313b","publisher":{}},"src":null,"text":"May 10, 2016","measurementHash":"30cabb070e19ca81945de99ce226583e","length":12,"measurementVersion":16},"html":"<h3>May 10, 2016</h3>"},{"block":{"id":"e80119d6-9606-44bf-a080-6020c39a6ddc","item":"2c4f8b91-f250-4d97-b48c-ec7e58b9313b","type":"h3","html":"<h3>May 6, 2016</h3>","created_at":"2016-08-08T14:36:50.114Z","updated_at":null,"metadata":{"starred":true,"source":"2c4f8b91-f250-4d97-b48c-ec7e58b9313b","publisher":{}},"src":null,"text":"May 6, 2016","measurementHash":"889372828a5410b0af5994f6b6639944","length":11,"measurementVersion":16},"html":"<h3>May 6, 2016</h3>"},{"block":{"id":"33fac7d6-cb0d-424d-b19c-689784b6c841","item":"2c4f8b91-f250-4d97-b48c-ec7e58b9313b","type":"h3","html":"<h3>May 1st, 2016</h3>","created_at":"2016-08-08T14:36:50.114Z","updated_at":null,"metadata":{"starred":true,"source":"2c4f8b91-f250-4d97-b48c-ec7e58b9313b","publisher":{}},"src":null,"text":"May 1st, 2016","measurementHash":"ef56863e3a87e55a7d0dc6e0391ab825","length":13,"measurementVersion":16},"html":"<h3>May 1st, 2016</h3>"}],"text":[{"block":{"id":"1cab7f1d-e8fa-4f1c-a1a0-a36aae97e102","item":"2c4f8b91-f250-4d97-b48c-ec7e58b9313b","type":"text","html":"<p>Frank and I headed out to Galway for a weekend away.
