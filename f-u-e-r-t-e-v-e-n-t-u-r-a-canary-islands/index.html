Oh hey, let's set it on the bookshelf under that stuff there. I won't forget it's there. No way.\" Come nearly Mid-April, the passport was nowhere to be found. With absolute panic, I Ubered to the county building and rushed in every way possible an application for new papers... which I was assured would be in my hands no later than April 29th -- I was told not to freak out till May 1. And freak out I did April 27th when I got an email that my application was on hold due to a form they needed in hardcopy (although I had submitted it online... this was the DS-64, a form stating how you lost your passport. I had simply put, \"I'm stressed out and somehow I misplaced it. I have no idea how.\") Since it's 1974 at the Passport office, I needed to resubmit this form in blood, hand delivered by Pony Express...Thence, the panic really was building. I wasn't sleeping, I was pounding coffee, eating excessively to soothe, and hittin' that bong like nothing. I was on the phone daily with various passport customer service people who ranged from sassy dick-head, \"Mitch\" who called me \"ma'am\" about 40 times, to Charles who soothed my like only Morgan Freeman could, Pam the robot who could only say \"your application is processing,\" to finally Meagan, who I told I loved and who gave me the tracking number for my overnighted delivery. I'm finally feeling like this is real, and I'm letting myself feel excited rather than beating myself up for being so careless. Here I come Dublin, Paris, Amsterdam, Oslo, Tel Aviv, Petra, Prague, and who knows where else with my sweet person who through all the distance, the longing, the fears, I'm still so enamored with and truly joyful I get the honor of living with for a spell.","measurementHash":"5a5e1eb26af2fa8b5735fabdf8ac1a72","length":2145,"language":"en","measurementVersion":16},{"id":"a808e8f3-39cb-4a15-8118-7e5e7572381a","item":"2c4f8b91-f250-4d97-b48c-ec7e58b9313b","type":"h2","html":"<h2>A L W A Y S &amp; F O R E V E R</h2>","created_at":"2016-08-10T20:13:25.233Z","updated_at":null,"metadata":{"starred":true,"source":"2c4f8b91-f250-4d97-b48c-ec7e58b9313b","publisher":{}},"src":null,"text":"A L W A Y S & F O R E V E R","measurementHash":"0cafc674fc6b779a6e514a0e9671ae5a","length":27,"measurementVersion":16},{"id":"6a6d8309-3c03-452e-8409-4a080653575b","item":"2c4f8b91-f250-4d97-b48c-ec7e58b9313b","type":"h3","html":"<h3>May 1st, 2016</h3>","created_at":"2016-08-10T20:13:25.233Z","updated_at":null,"metadata":{"starred":true,"source":"2c4f8b91-f250-4d97-b48c-ec7e58b9313b","publisher":{}},"src":null,"text":"May 1st, 2016","measurementHash":"ef56863e3a87e55a7d0dc6e0391ab825","length":13,"measurementVersion":16},{"id":"ae17035b-c964-4961-a48a-46a25cb9a75e","item":"2c4f8b91-f250-4d97-b48c-ec7e58b9313b","type":"text","html":"<p>As I prepare to leave PDX, the place I’ve been calling my own special prison for the last several months, I’m moved by some pretty important noticing.</p>","created_at":"2016-08-10T20:13:25.233Z","updated_at":null,"metadata":{"starred":true,"source":"2c4f8b91-f250-4d97-b48c-ec7e58b9313b","publisher":{}},"src":null,"text":"As I prepare to leave PDX, the place I’ve been calling my own special prison for the last several months, I’m moved by some pretty important noticing.","measurementHash":"03a01a68335b5577da48198aecd0742d","length":150,"language":"en","measurementVersion":16},{"id":"6235e613-d4e7-48e0-a206-e04d28ce3a47","item":"2c4f8b91-f250-4d97-b48c-ec7e58b9313b","type":"text","html":"<p>Portland is likely the best place to live in the US.

I hate being asked personal questions by a stranger. Fuck, open my bags and look through everything, pat me down, swab me, but really my relationship is none of anyone’s business but my own. And why I’m in a place, as long as I’m bomb-free, shouldn’t concern you. I hate, hate, hate, boarders. They make me feel like I’m in prison. I just wish we could all move about the world as we please with no risks of imminent danger. But that’s not the global community we have quite yet. I’ve been getting hassled more and more each time I re-enter Ireland, and it is extremely anxiety provoking for me, so much so that I don’t feel like even leaving again till I head back to the states, which is going to be a horrible nightmare at that boarder crossing, too, I’m sure! When we left Israel we were questioned 5 times. We were leaving, had had both our bags ransacked, and still we were probed more.

I hate being asked personal questions by a stranger. Fuck, open my bags and look through everything, pat me down, swab me, but really my relationship is none of anyone’s business but my own. And why I’m in a place, as long as I’m bomb-free, shouldn’t concern you. I hate, hate, hate, boarders. They make me feel like I’m in prison. I just wish we could all move about the world as we please with no risks of imminent danger. But that’s not the global community we have quite yet. I’ve been getting hassled more and more each time I re-enter Ireland, and it is extremely anxiety provoking for me, so much so that I don’t feel like even leaving again till I head back to the states, which is going to be a horrible nightmare at that boarder crossing, too, I’m sure! When we left Israel we were questioned 5 times. We were leaving, had had both our bags ransacked, and still we were probed more.
