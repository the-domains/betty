            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>C A L M A F T E R T H E S T O R M</h1><p>05/06/16:::::At the beginning of April, I started thinking about starting my journey, packing up my house for my delightful subletter, and getting things in order to the tune of getting rid of heaps of shit I no longer need or use, cleaning, and organizing my frightfully disorganized existence. That was when I started to think about, "Hey girl, you should take your passport out of your backpack from that fun trip to Canada last month. Oh hey, let's set it on the bookshelf under that stuff there. I won't forget it's there. No way." Come nearly Mid-April, the passport was nowhere to be found. With absolute panic, I Ubered to the county building and rushed in every way possible an application for new papers... which I was assured would be in my hands no later than April 29th -- I was told not to freak out till May 1. And freak out I did April 27th when I got an email that my application was on hold due to a form they needed in hardcopy (although I had submitted it online... this was the DS-64, a form stating how you lost your passport. I had simply put, "I'm stressed out and somehow I misplaced it. I have no idea how.") Since it's 1974 at the Passport office, I needed to resubmit this form in blood, hand delivered by Pony Express...Thence, the panic really was building. I wasn't sleeping, I was pounding coffee, eating excessively to soothe, and hittin' that bong like nothing. I was on the phone daily with various passport customer service people who ranged from sassy dick-head, "Mitch" who called me "ma'am" about 40 times, to Charles who soothed my like only Morgan Freeman could, Pam the robot who could only say "your application is processing," to finally Meagan, who I told I loved and who gave me the tracking number for my overnighted delivery. I'm finally feeling like this is real, and I'm letting myself feel excited rather than beating myself up for being so careless. Here I come Dublin, Paris, Amsterdam, Oslo, Tel Aviv, Petra, Prague, and who knows where else with my sweet person who through all the distance, the longing, the fears, I'm still so enamored with and truly joyful I get the honor of living with for a spell.</p></article>]]></description>
