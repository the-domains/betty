And I’ll continue to do my best with this amazing privilege that’s been bestowed upon me. I don’t know where I’ll be visiting next, but we may actually be going back to Tel Aviv in July. I think I want to go to Spain or someplace else on the Mediterranean Sea. It makes me so happy to be near the sea. Hopefully I can take a deep breath and chill the fuck out about the nerves I get on the boarders of the world.","measurementHash":"fdf8216348c2be7476e4732bf7a5231d","length":496,"language":"en","measurementVersion":16}],"sites":["the-domains/betty"],"publisher":{},"starredBlocks":{"h1":[{"block":{"id":"644c8c14-55b5-43b3-ba17-189416172e8d","item":"06afadc6-3ed5-467a-bed0-64629140407c","type":"h1","html":"<h1>Traveling is sorta hard.</h1>","created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"metadata":{"starred":true,"source":"06afadc6-3ed5-467a-bed0-64629140407c","publisher":{}},"src":null,"text":"Traveling is sorta hard.","measurementHash":"58bdf16505fd4f41e5d3d76b8eb35d6b","length":24,"language":"en","measurementVersion":16},"html":"<h1>Traveling is sorta hard.</h1>"}],"image":[{"block":{"id":"4bdc9890-512e-4bf6-93aa-b5282d36b7b8","item":"06afadc6-3ed5-467a-bed0-64629140407c","type":"image","html":"<img src=\"https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/f4cfe7b1-11e0-4e38-907b-c03bdd50aa54.jpg\" alt=\"Tel Aviv Beach\">","created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"metadata":{"datePublished":null,"caption":"Tel Aviv Beach","isBasedOnUrl":"https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/f4cfe7b1-11e0-4e38-907b-c03bdd50aa54.jpg","@context":"http://schema.org","coverPrefs":{"filter":false,"overlay":false},"@type":"Article","source":"06afadc6-3ed5-467a-bed0-64629140407c","publisher":{},"description":"","starred":true},"caption":"Tel Aviv Beach","cover":{"src":"https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/f4cfe7b1-11e0-4e38-907b-c03bdd50aa54.jpg","animated":false,"exif":{"exif":{"image":{"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Instagram","ExifOffset":112,"GPSInfo":890},"thumbnail":{},"exif":{"ExposureTime":0.001176470588235294,"FNumber":2.2,"ExposureProgram":2,"ISO":32,"ShutterSpeedValue":9.730670103092784,"ApertureValue":2.2750072066878064,"BrightnessValue":9.050102249488752,"ExposureCompensation":[],"MeteringMode":3,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":2.65,"ColorSpace":1,"ExifImageWidth":961,"ExifImageHeight":1280,"SensingMethod":2,"ExposureMode":[],"WhiteBalance":[],"FocalLengthIn35mmFormat":31,"SceneCaptureType":[],"LensInfo":[2.65,2.65,2.2,2.2],"LensMake":"Apple","LensModel":"iPhone 6s Plus front camera 2.65mm f/2.2"},"gps":{"GPSLatitudeRef":"N","GPSLatitude":[32,5,11.68],"GPSLongitudeRef":"E","GPSLongitude":[34,46,9.58],"GPSAltitude":27.576251455180444,"GPSTimeStamp":[9,4,5],"GPSDOP":65,"GPSDateStamp":"2016:06:18"},"interoperability":{},"makernote":{"error":"Unable to extract Makernote information as it is in an unsupported or unrecognized format."}}},"factor":1.25,"rotation":0,"imgflosrc":"https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/f4cfe7b1-11e0-4e38-907b-c03bdd50aa54.jpg","resized":"http://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/caliper-resized/4aaddde2c0359275be60717158c79932.png","original":"https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/f4cfe7b1-11e0-4e38-907b-c03bdd50aa54.jpg","width":961,"height":1280,"aspect":0.7509765625,"ratio":"769:1024","orientation":"portrait","colors":[[12,14,13],[147,178,245],[199,229,255],[133,109,109],[95,64,62]],"faces":[{"x":163.75,"y":243.75,"width":480,"height":480,"confidence":5.007562},{"x":293.75,"y":1020,"width":32.5,"height":32.5,"confidence":4.998759}],"saliency":{"bounding_rect":[[1.25,55],[783.75,1278.75]],"confidence":0.247267,"center":[391.25,727.5],"radius":694.79125}},"measurementHash":"4aaddde2c0359275be60717158c79932","language":"sv","measurementVersion":16},"html":"<img src=\"https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/f4cfe7b1-11e0-4e38-907b-c03bdd50aa54.jpg\" alt=\"Tel Aviv Beach\">"}],"text":[{"block":{"id":"2ec1f54d-3ca3-40d9-aa34-cc2a67b0d13b","item":"06afadc6-3ed5-467a-bed0-64629140407c","type":"text","html":"<p>I’ve long romanticized travel as this amazing thing only the privileged get to do.

Glad I have a video call with my therapist this week!</p>"},{"block":{"id":"fe1147c9-9df0-414c-a336-a390ed36cbe6","item":"06afadc6-3ed5-467a-bed0-64629140407c","type":"text","html":"<p>I shouldn’t complain, I should go with the flow, look at the bright side, all that.
