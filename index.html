I need at least 6 hours of sleep in a lay-flat position to be a functional human. I don’t know how there are those of us (Frank) who can appear a normal human being with no sleep and no comfort. I guess these things take time. And I’m grateful to have a partner ho hasn’t left me in a terminal as I act a monster. If I could just smoke a little weed at the airport I’d be totally fine...","measurementHash":"5eeb40181a50fbb7ed355aae5a8da37f","length":576,"language":"en","measurementVersion":16},{"id":"47a0a197-8cc4-4ca1-94ec-6233327ad29c","item":"06afadc6-3ed5-467a-bed0-64629140407c","type":"text","html":"<p>Things I hate about traveling mostly have to do with the getting to and leaving from aspects, ie. the airport in general.
