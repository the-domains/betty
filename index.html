And why I’m in a place, as long as I’m bomb-free, shouldn’t concern you. I hate, hate, hate, boarders. They make me feel like I’m in prison. I just wish we could all move about the world as we please with no risks of imminent danger. But that’s not the global community we have quite yet. I’ve been getting hassled more and more each time I re-enter Ireland, and it is extremely anxiety provoking for me, so much so that I don’t feel like even leaving again till I head back to the states, which is going to be a horrible nightmare at that boarder crossing, too, I’m sure! When we left Israel we were questioned 5 times. We were leaving, had had both our bags ransacked, and still we were probed more. Frank has a trip to London coming up and I’ve decided to stay home in Dublin partially because I can’t bear the boarder again.
