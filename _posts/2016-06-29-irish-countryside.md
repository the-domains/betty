# Irish Countryside

26 June 2016

Saw a ton of cool Neolithic sites outside of Dublin with my little cousin Sylvie who surprised me with her presence! We saw The Hill of Tara, Monasterboice, Trim Castle, and the [Loughcrew Megalithic Cairns. ][0]It was super interesting, though the weather was shit all day. It was fun to bond with the lil cousin and Frank and see tons of cool ancient stuff. More later!
