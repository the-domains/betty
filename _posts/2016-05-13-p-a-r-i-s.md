I've been in Paris for a few days, sadly mostly working. I'm glad it's Friday, because I'm gonna get my walk on, see some gardens, art, culture, and eat all the cheese and bread I can. I'm having a relaxing wonderful time. Photos to come! Frank and I were talking and snuggling last night and he helped me remember that I am here. We aren't 5000 miles apart anymore. It's strange how it takes a while to let that sensation settle in and feel normal. We've spent the majority of our relationship away from each other, and I'm glad I have him to remind me to be in the moment.
