I've literally never been so jet lagged. Never again will I suffer a 12 hour layover. I refuse! Or, if I do have to do two red eyes in a row again, this queen is going to have some serious sleeping pills or other fun Rx drugs. 

I've been in Paris for a few days, sadly mostly working. I'm glad it's Friday, because I'm gonna get my walk on, see some gardens, art, culture, and eat all the cheese and bread I can. I'm having a relaxing wonderful time. Photos to come! Frank and I were talking and snuggling last night and he helped me remember that I am here. We aren't 5000 miles apart anymore. It's strange how it takes a while to let that sensation settle in and feel normal. We've spent the majority of our relationship away from each other, and I'm glad I have him to remind me to be in the moment.
