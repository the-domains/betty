A L W A Y S & F O R E V E R

As I prepare to leave PDX, the place I've been calling my own special prison for the last several months, I'm moved by some pretty important noticings.

Portland is likely the best place to live in the US. As I think about how much of a struggle it'll be to get my groceries delivered, the spicy chai @Good Coffee, pre-mourn the bike riding joy the summer months bring, my sweet baby cats, and the good friends I'll miss --- I'm not gonna lie. I'm sad to leave.

The past few months have been hugely stressful. Dealing with my hugest tax bill of all time, a job that no longer made me feel valued, cat health issues, crushing depression & anxiety, and a mysteriously lost passport, I'm seriously looking forward to snuggling down with Frank and trying not to get too fat on potatoes with a side of potatoes.

I hope to really do some living this summer. I feel like my life has been on pause in a bogus sort of way for too long and it's time to get it going in the direction I've been working toward for the past two years.
