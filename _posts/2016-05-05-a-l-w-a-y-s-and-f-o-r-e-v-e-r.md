I'm going to Germany next week! We'll be in DÃ¼sseldorf for a couple days, then Cologne. I'm excited for the various beers of the area, river walks, museums, and cool old architecture. Oh, also sausages. Obviously. I'm very thankful for my remote job that I can do anywhere, any time, and still make a good living, and for Frank's jet-setting work schedule. It's pretty cool. Not gonna lie, Europe makes me want to smoke cigarettes. It's basically exactly like the Nick Kroll spoof on Europeans here everyplace we go. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YCOT5LasKc

### I'm enjoying myself and getting accustomed to this normal existence in Dublin for a little while. **Paris** was great this time around (I think this was my 3rd time...). I finally went to the Louvre, which while my typically curmudgeonly attitude will turn her nose up at touristy things, it's nice to remember that that shit is pretty awesome to see! I could have spent a lot more time Louvre-ing, but alas it closed early on Sunday and I didn't get to see as much of the ancient stuff as I'd have liked to. Next time I'll be bee-lining to the Egyptian and Islamic artifacts and mostly skipping the galleries of paintings.

Next week we'll be going to **Oslo**, since Frank has some biz there, I'm going to tag along. I can't wait to see some really old [Viking][0] stuff and eat a bunch of weird smoked fish. We're staying in a swanky Oslo hotel for the first part of the trip, then relocating to a cute and tiny AirBnB. Hotels are insanely expensive in Oslo, and oh, they're currently having a hotel strike!? So thanks NR for the first few days!

More on Oslo::

The National Gallary here is so great. It's small and free! Two of my favorite things when it comes to National Gallaries.

This is how I feel about my flight tomorrow morning at 7 something. Excited to be back in Dublin though!!

I've literally never been so jet lagged. Never again will I suffer a 12 hour layover. I refuse! Or, if I do have to do two red eyes in a row again, this queen is going to have some serious sleeping pills or other fun Rx drugs.

I've been in Paris for a few days, sadly mostly working. I'm glad it's Friday, because I'm gonna get my walk on, see some gardens, art, culture, and eat all the cheese and bread I can. I'm having a relaxing wonderful time. Photos to come! Frank and I were talking and snuggling last night and he helped me remember that I am here. We aren't 5000 miles apart anymore. It's strange how it takes a while to let that sensation settle in and feel normal. We've spent the majority of our relationship away from each other, and I'm glad I have him to remind me to be in the

This is the view from Frank's cute apartment. The weather's in the 60s usually, both day/night. Seagulls squawk from the [rooftops][1], and horny pigeons coo outside the [window][1] all morning long.

At the beginning of April, I started thinking about starting my journey, packing up my house for my delightful subletter, and getting things in order to the tune of getting rid of heaps of shit I no longer need or use, cleaning, and organizing my frightfully disorganized existence. That was when I started to think about, "Hey girl, you should take your passport out of your backpack from that fun trip to Canada last month. Oh hey, let's set it on the bookshelf under that stuff there. I won't forget it's there. No way." Come nearly Mid-April, the passport was nowhere to be found. With absolute panic, I Ubered to the county building and rushed in every way possible an application for new papers... which I was assured would be in my hands no later than April 29th -- I was told not to freak out till May 1\. And freak out I did April 27th when I got an email that my application was on hold due to a form they needed in hardcopy (although I had submitted it online... this was the DS-64, a form stating how you lost your passport. I had simply put, "I'm stressed out and somehow I misplaced it. I have no idea how.") Since it's 1974 at the Passport office, I needed to resubmit this form in blood, hand delivered by Pony Express...Thence, the panic really was building. I wasn't sleeping, I was pounding coffee, eating excessively to soothe, and hittin' that bong like nothing. I was on the phone daily with various passport customer service people who ranged from sassy dick-head, "Mitch" who called me "ma'am" about 40 times, to Charles who soothed my like only Morgan Freeman could, Pam the robot who could only say "your application is processing," to finally Meagan, who I told I loved and who gave me the tracking number for my overnighted delivery. I'm finally feeling like this is real, and I'm letting myself feel excited rather than beating myself up for being so careless. Here I come Dublin, Paris, Amsterdam, Oslo, Tel Aviv, Petra, Prague, and who knows where else with my sweet person who through all the distance, the longing, the fears, I'm still so enamored with and truly joyful I get the honor of living with for a spell.

As I prepare to leave PDX, the place I've been calling my own special prison for the last several months, I'm moved by some pretty important noticing.

Portland is likely the best place to live in the US. As I think about how much of a struggle it'll be to get my groceries delivered, the spicy chai @GoodCoffeePDX, pre-mourn the bike riding joy the summer months bring, my sweet baby cats, and the good friends I'll miss --- I'm not gonna lie. I'm sad to leave.

The past few months have been hugely stressful. Dealing with my hugest tax bill of all time, a job that no longer made me feel valued, cat health issues, crushing depression & anxiety, and a mysteriously lost passport, I'm seriously looking forward to snuggling down with Frank and trying not to get too fat on potatoes with a side of potatoes.

I hope to really do some living this summer. I feel like my life has been on pause in a bogus sort of way for too long and it's time to get it going in the direction I've been working toward for the past two years.
