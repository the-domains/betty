  Next week we’ll be going to Oslo, since Frank has some biz there, I’m going to
  tag along. I can’t wait to see some really old Viking stuff and eat a bunch of
  weird smoked fish. We’re staying in a swanky Oslo hotel for the first part of
  the trip, then relocating to a cute and tiny AirBnB. Hotels are insanely
  expensive in Oslo, and oh, they’re currently having a hotel strike!? So thanks
  NR for the first few days!

# O S L O --- Here we come

### I'm enjoying myself and getting accustomed to this normal existence in Dublin for a little while. **Paris** was great this time around (I think this was my 3rd time...). I finally went to the Louvre, which while my typically curmudgeonly attitude will turn her nose up at touristy things, it's nice to remember that that shit is pretty awesome to see! I could have spent a lot more time Louvre-ing, but alas it closed early on Sunday and I didn't get to see as much of the ancient stuff as I'd have liked to. Next time I'll be bee-lining to the Egyptian and Islamic artifacts and mostly skipping the galleries of paintings.

Next week we'll be going to **Oslo**, since Frank has some biz there, I'm going to tag along. I can't wait to see some really old [Viking][0] stuff and eat a bunch of weird smoked fish.

This is the view from Frank's cute apartment. The weather's in the 60s usually, both day/night. Seagulls squawk from the [rooftops][1], and horny pigeons coo outside the [window][1] all morning long.

As I prepare to leave PDX, the place I've been calling my own special prison for the last several months, I'm moved by some pretty important noticing.

Portland is likely the best place to live in the US. As I think about how much of a struggle it'll be to get my groceries delivered, the spicy chai @GoodCoffeePDX, pre-mourn the bike riding joy the summer months bring, my sweet baby cats, and the good friends I'll miss --- I'm not gonna lie. I'm sad to leave.

The past few months have been hugely stressful. Dealing with my hugest tax bill of all time, a job that no longer made me feel valued, cat health issues, crushing depression & anxiety, and a mysteriously lost passport, I'm seriously looking forward to snuggling down with Frank and trying not to get too fat on potatoes with a side of potatoes.

I hope to really do some living this summer. I feel like my life has been on pause in a bogus sort of way for too long and it's time to get it going in the direction I've been working toward for the past two years.
