<article style=""><h1>O S L O we're coming for you.</h1></article>

I'm enjoying myself and getting accustomed to this normal existence in Dublin for a little while. **Paris** was great this time around (I think this was my 3rd time...). I finally went to the Louvre, which while my typically curmudgeonly attitude will turn her nose up at touristy things, it's nice to remember that that shit is pretty awesome to see! I could have spent a lot more time Louvre-ing, but alas it closed early on Sunday and I didn't get to see as much of the ancient stuff as I'd have liked to. Next time I'll be bee-lining to the Egyptian and Islamic artifacts and mostly skipping the galleries of paintings.

We were going to go to **Amsterdam** this coming weekend, but funds are a little tight in this time of work transition and taxation payment, so we're saving that for later in the summer. Next week we'll be going to **Oslo**, since Frank has some biz there, I'm going to tag along. I can't wait to see s[ome really old Viking stuff][0] and eat a bunch of weird smoked fish.
