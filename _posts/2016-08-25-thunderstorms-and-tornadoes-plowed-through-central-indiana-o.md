Thunderstorms and tornadoes plowed through central Indiana on Wednesday, demolishing numerous homes and a Starbucks cafe in Kokomo and cutting power to thousands of Indianapolis-area residents, but no serious injuries were immediately reported.

The National Weather Service issued a bulletin saying a "confirmed large and extremely dangerous" tornado had struck near Indianapolis, the state's capital and largest city, as severe storms rolled [through][0] the region in the late afternoon.

The Weather Service also reported that a Starbucks coffee shop was demolished in Kokomo, a city of 45,000 people about 60 miles (97 km) north of Indianapolis, but said there were no immediate reports of anyone hurt.

[Video footage][1] apparently shot with a cellphone through the window of a bar across the street and aired by Indianapolis-based NBC News affiliate [WTHR-TV][2] showed the entire front wall and facade of the Starbucks collapsing in the wind.
