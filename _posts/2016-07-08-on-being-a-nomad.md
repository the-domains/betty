# On being a Nomad

I've long romanticized the idea of going out and traveling in far places here and there, going nowhere in particular and having no real schedule, just existing, working my remote job, and seeing the world.

So far, I've been to Oslo, Paris, Dusseldorf, Cologne, London, and Tel Aviv. I've discovered this about myself: I have a really hard time picking up and go go going, and I'd rather stay in one place for a while, or travel by bus or train within one region for a spell. They way airport security and passport control is right now makes country hopping a highly anxiety provoking experience for me. I really don't like being around machine guns and being detained by twerpish airport security men. I've come to see that I'm not even much of a short tripper either. I'm not so into the 2-3 day trip. It feels hectic and unsettled to me, with little time to get a real feel for place or culture. 

This is all not to say that I'm not enjoying myself on other levels, because I am. Growth and going outside your comfort realms is fucking intense, especially when you're 33 going on 70\. Maybe I'd be better accustomed to changes and being uncomfortable if I'd lead a different life, traveled more as a 20 something, or didn't constantly feel panic about money. Maybe I'd be more relaxed if I hadn't accrued a mountain of student loans in my late 20s in grad school. Maybe if the economy hadn't fallen apart in the spring of my adulthood in Portland I'd not fear the unknown like I do. Maybe 100 things. 

With all that, I'm figuring myself out, not in like, an eat/pray/love sort of way exactly, but maybe kinda? I guess I should go to Tuscany now and bask in the sun or something. That actually sounds amazing.
