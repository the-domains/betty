The weather in this nook of the world is so crazy. It's midwestern weather x100000\. It'll be warm and sunny for 20 min, then it'll downpour for 30 min, then it'll be hot and breezy, then you'll need a winter coat, then the streets will be flooded.

We're off to Oslo tomorrow! I got a note from our AirBnB host over the weekend letting me know that her family needed to use the apt that we reserved, and so she's putting us up in a quite swanky pad in a cool 'hood that she usually rents for more than double what we booked for, and she's giving it to us for no extra fee... SO excited about the new, cuter and nicer location! Here's the listing. https://www.airbnb.ie/rooms/12573718

You can buy a 24 hour pass that gets you into every museum in Oslo for about $40, so Frank and I will be making a day of it this coming Saturday.

In other news, I just realized that there's a BOG BODIES exhibit at the Archaeology Museum here in Dublin (all museums are free here...) http://www.museum.ie/Archaeology/Exhibitions/Current-Exhibitions/Kingship-and-Sacrifice... So I'll be doing that this week.

OK byeeee.
