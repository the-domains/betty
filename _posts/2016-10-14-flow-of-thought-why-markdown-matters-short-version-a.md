  # Flow of Thought: ## Why Markdown Matters (Short version) A thought rattled
  about in my head and got mugged on the way to the webpage, loosing its value
  and spending a lot of time and effort trying to reclaim its former greatness
  from the thugs who pilfered it away. [Markdown to the
  rescue!](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) Simple, easy formatting
  without having to leave the keyboard or have the screen jump all over the
  place. Markdown! Because ideas that matter (and they all do, to we arrogant
  thought creators, don’t they?) deserve to arrive at their destination all
  gussied up, without harassment. [Want some
  details?](https://ia.net/writer/support/general/markdown-guide#toc) ## Why
  Markdown Matters (Longerish version) ### Science says write in cursive. I am a
  writer. My physical workflow usually begins with pencil and paper, writing in
  cursive. Why? Because writing in cursive keeps up with, and actually promotes,
  flow of thought. That is how my blog posts begin. Search the interwebs for
  cursive handwriting and you’ll see what I mean. Pick up a pencil and quality
  paper and, after a few days of relearning cursive, or a few months of learning
  it from scratch, you’ll suddenly realize just how kludgy a keyboard is for
  thought. It’s no accident Twitter limits itself to 140 characters (for the
  moment anyroad). ### Markdown magic Then I type these pages into iA Writer on
  my Mac. It is as close to a pencil as a computer app can get (closer than
  those horrid e-pencil boppers). Simple and minimalist, yet a lot of power in
  that simplicity. It uses Markdown, a shockingly simple way of formatting text
  files for HTML. You now have the sum total of my techie knowledge. But with
  Markdown, as I type my cursive pencil on paper writing into electrons, giving
  them my first edit in the transition, structure emerges even further and,
  without disrupting the precious flow of thought, I can edit that structure in.
  These subheadings? That’s when they got added in. Without having to bumble
  around through an interface or take my fingers off the keyboard to the
  trackpad. I can even create block quotes, lists, links in text and more. ###
  Thwarted by the evil empire! When forced to do this part of the process in the
  kludgy web editor (and no way for it to be otherwise, it’s the nature of the
  beast trying to be text editor, photo layout, and word processor all at once),
  I have a choice: try and type directly into the editor (in which case my flow
  of thought is obliterated within moments) or format it in iA Writer and copy
  and paste it one painful line or paragraph at a time. Why? My MacOS Mail app
  allows me to paste markdown into it and it shows up just fine. This very email
  was written in Markdown and copied directly into Mail, no formatting required
  on my part. ### Yet hope remains … if we but dare(ing fireball) If you want to
  cater to people who write, not just people who link or take pictures, you need
  an editor that grasps and applies markdown editing. ## Why Markdown? - it’s
  standard web editor behavior and thus part of polite society - simple, no
  harassment writing and formatting for thoughts that matter - It’s the right
  thing to do and makes plain business sense ## Try it, you’ll like it! I’ve
  attached to this email the plain text file containing Markdown formatting for
  headers links and lists (and whatever else I’ve done). Using that file, try
  this: 1. Open the text file 2. Select all 3. Copy as RTF or formatted (this
  may require a markdown specific text editor, like iA Writer) 3. Paste into a
  new email. 4. Like what you get? (If all goes well, it should like nearly
  identical to the email I sent) 5. Paste that same text into The Grid’s editor.
  6. Like what you get? (I’m betting not)
