  "The next time you lose heart and you can’t bear to experience what you’re
  feeling, you might recall this instruction: change the way you see it and lean
  in. Instead of blaming our discomfort on outer circumstances or on our own
  weakness, we can choose to stay present and awake to our experience, not
  rejecting it, not grasping it, not buying the stories that we relentlessly
  tell ourselves. This is priceless advice that addresses the true cause of
  suffering—yours, mine, and that of all beings." — Taking the Leap by Pema
